My final project for the General Assembly course. Experimenting with the 3D Javascript library Three.js to load, display, and annotate iconic vehicles from the NASA missions. The models were publicly available, converted, and loaded into a space-like environment along with information, videos, and interactives. The app features five different machines: the Voyager Probe, Gemini Capsule, Saturn V Rocket, Lunar Lander, and the Apollo-Soyuz. The goal of the project was to create a learning platform that was also design conscious, my personal goal was to learn a lot more about how to model in three dimensions on the web.
